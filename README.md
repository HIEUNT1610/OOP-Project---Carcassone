# OOP-Project---Carcassone

This is an end of semester project for the class Object Oriented Programming at the University Paris Cite'. We use Java to implement the game Domino and Carcassone.

Our game of Domino is a 4-sided Domino game. We implemented the game in a way that it can be played by many human players or by a human player and a computer player. The computer player uses a simple strategy to play the game. The game is played in the terminal.

Our game of Carcasson is an extension of the 4-sided Domino game. We implemented the game in the same way as the Domino game, with the visualization of the cards and the board. The computer player uses a simple strategy to play the game. The game is also played in the terminal.
